# numpy-RNN
This project contains the implementation of a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) in Python using only numpy and no other high level machine learning/neural network APIs or libraries. It is the first in a series of projects, and is developed with an aim to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts involved in designing and training RNNs.

In this project, a RNN is trained on a corpus of characters to enable it to predict the next character given previous characters.

## Dependencies
Only 3 dependecies for the code - 
- Python 2.7
- numpy
- jupyter

## Instructions
Install Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the directory containing `numpy-RNN.ipynb` in the command terminal and run the notebook by typing - 

`$ jupyter notebook numpy-RNN.ipynb`

This will open the notebook in a browser. Execute each cell in the notebook one by one.

## Usage
This code was written using [Andrej Karpathy's](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) code, and his [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
